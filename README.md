<h2>AGENDA</h2>
<p>Create a web application that presents a quiz to the user and incorporates public API integrations for additional functionality.</p>

<h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>

- Create a Web Application to present a quiz to the end user.
- The application should have a user registration screen, where user will enter User Name, questions category, number of questions and level of difficulty.
- The application should have a set of multiple-choice questions related to a specific topic. Include at least 5 questions in your quiz.
- Display one question at a time to the user, along with the available answer options.
- Allow the user to select one answer option per question.
- Each question should have a time limit of 20 seconds. A timer should be visible next to the question.
- If user does not answer within 20 seconds, provide immediate feedback to the user indicating the correct answer.
- If user answers the questions, provide immediate feedback to the user after selecting an answer, indicating whether the answer is correct or incorrect.
- Track the user's score based on the number of correct answers.
- Integrate a public API to add additional functionality to the quiz, such as fetching additional information related to the quiz topic or displaying relevant data.
- Use HTML, SCSS/CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface and handle user interactions.
- Implement a visually appealing design using SCSS/CSS to make the application attractive and ser-friendly.
- Handle any potential errors or edge cases, such as if there is an issue with the API request or if the user tries to submit without answering all the questions.
- Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes and devices.

<h2>HINTS</h2>

- Choose a public API that provides data related to the quiz topic. For example, you can use the Open Trivia API (https://opentdb.com/) to fetch quiz questions or any other relevant API.
- Use JavaScript's fetch() function or any HTTP library to make API requests and retrieve data from the API.
- Parse the API response and extract the necessary information to integrate it into your quiz application.
- Consider displaying additional information from the API, such as images, descriptions, or related facts, to enhance the user's quiz experience.
- Note: Make sure to review and comply with the terms of use and API usage guidelines of the chosen public API.
